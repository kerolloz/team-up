        <h3 class="ui header">What is the idea of TEAM UP?</h3>
        <p>
            The main idea is to help students to team up for their graduation project. You know, since our first year,
            we
            have always been struggling to team up for a project.
        </p>
        <p>
            In short, students who haven't joined a team will register. Students who have an idea will search for other
            students who haven't joined a team yet.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="ui orange segment">
        <h3 class="ui header"> What does the phrasl verb <em>team up</em> mean? </h3>
        <p>
            It means to join another person, or form a group with other people, in order to do something together.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="ui yellow segment">
        <h3 class="ui header">Why should I register in TEAM UP? </h3>
        <p>
            As <a href="#1">mentioned before</a> it would make our life easier.<br>
            <blockquote><em><b>"Save the hassle for the project."</b></em></blockquote>

        </p>
        <p>
            For example, Let's say that I have an idea for a project. I need a team. My idea will need someone who is
            good at <em>python</em>. With TEAM UP, that's a pice of cake.
            I will just <a href="./students.html">search for students</a>
            who have python in their skill set. Send him/her an email.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, If I don't have an idea for a project.
            I would go <a href="registration.html">register</a> myself, fill up a 3-field small form, and booom.
            Now, I am into the database, someone will find me suitable to join his project according to my skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Easy, isn't it?
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="ui olive segment">
        <h3 class="ui header">Why email, why not facebook profile or phone number?</h3>
        <p>
            I see that email would be much easier means of communication.
            It's up to you, you can ask for the student's facebook profile or phone number when you contact him/her via
            email.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="ui green segment">
        <h3 class="ui header">Why should I trust TEAM UP?</h3>
